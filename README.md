# GoldMind
GoldMind is a 2D Rouge-like game that depicts a childâ€™s creative mind as he illustrates his own adventure. Players must navigate through randomly generated rooms, slaying enemies and buying upgrades, in order to find the GoldMind. This is a capstone project from college, which I worked alongside several classmates to create.

# My Contribution to the Project:
- Scripted for several of the AI in the game, most notably the Alien UFO boss
- Configured sprites, animations, and SFX that teammates created or found
- Programmed UI to update player health, bomb and coin count, and the mini-map
- Created and frequently updated the game design document for this project
- Led team in presentation and Q&A during our class' bi-weekly sprint meetings
